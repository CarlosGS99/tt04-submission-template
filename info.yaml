# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      This project consist in an unsigned binary multiplier. The multiplier works using the method of shift and add.
      The multiplier works by multiplying inputs A and B, each of then with 4 bits, and calculating a resulting 8 bits product.
      

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      The multiplier calculates the product of two 4-bit numbers, inputs A and B, and sending this product to 8-bit output B.
      This project works as a secuential design so it needs a clock signal.
      For testing the project just connect the input pins to switches and the output pins to LEDs or a decoder and a display.
      If reset signal is enabled the output will turn to 0.

      As a master’s student at the University of Guadalajara in the area of digital circuits, 
      having the possibility to manufacture an integrated circuit could be a very significant
      achievement both for the professional growth at personal level and for the 
      complete career of the master’s degree in electronics and computing, which could lead 
      to more students interested in the area of integrated circuits.
